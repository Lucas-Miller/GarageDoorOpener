# GarageDoorOpener
Control your garage door via Bluetooth using an Arduino Nano ESP32!

This project lets you control your garage door from your phone over bluetooth low energy. It uses an Arduino Nano ESP32 and a relay that gets wired in parallel to an existing wall mountained garage door button.

Root of the project is a Typescript React Native app that lets us send commands to the ESP32 Controller

The ESP32 Controller code is located in the GarageDoorController directory
